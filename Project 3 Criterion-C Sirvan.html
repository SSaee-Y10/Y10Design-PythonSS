				<li>1600BC - The first water clock is created. The bowl-shaped outflow is the simplest form of a water clock and is known to have existed in Babylon, Egypt, and Persia around the 16th century BC.</li>

				<li>3500BC - The first sundial is created. A sundial is a device that tells the time of day when there is sunlight by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky.</li>

				<li>300AD - The first sand glass clock is created. A sandglass is a device used to measure the passage of time. It comprises two glass bulbs connected vertically by a narrow neck that allows a regulated flow of a substance (historically sand) from the upper bulb to the lower one. </li>

				</iframe></li>

				<li>885 - The first Candle clock was introduced. A candle clock is a thin candle with consistently spaced markings that when burned, indicate the passage of periods of time. Candle clocks provided an effective way to tell time indoors, at night, or on a cloudy day.</li>

				</iframe></li>

				<li>1490 - The first clock main springs were invented. The main springs are hole end and loop end. The hole end is used inside a barrel and has a "D" or oval shaped hole at one end of the mainspring. This allows the mainspring to be attached to a fixed point such as a barrel hook which is used in mechanical parts of a clock.</li>

				<li>1510 - Peter Henlein invented the first mechanical watch. A mechanical watch is driven by a mainspring which must be wound either periodically by hand or via an automatic winding mechanism.</li>

				</iframe></li>

				<li>1656 - The first mechanical clocks, employing the verge escapement mechanism with a foliot or balance wheel timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the pendulum clock was invented in 1656.</li>

				</iframe></li>

				<li>1895 - The first modern electric clock is created by frank Hope-Jones.An electric clock is a clock that is powered by electricity, as opposed to a mechanical clock which is powered by a hanging weight or a mainspring.</li>

				<li>1942 - First atomic clock created by United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NITS). An atomic clock is a clock device that uses a hyperfine transition frequency in the microwave, or electron transition frequency in the optical or ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum of atoms as a frequency standard for its timekeeping element.</li>

				<li>2020 - Smart watches : A smartwatch is a wearable computer in the form of a wristwatch; modern smartwatches provide a local touchscreen interface for daily use, while an associated smartphone app provides for management and telemetry (such as long-term biomonitoring). Smart watches are also capable of running video games, making phone calles and tracking workout. </li>
